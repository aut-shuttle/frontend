# AUT Shuttle App's Front-End

## The Solution for a 21st Century University
The AUT Shuttle App is a solution 12 weeks in the making, that will say goodbye to traditional paper tickets on the shuttles connecting our university's 3 campuses.

*Problem:* Currently, there are outdated, manual and tedious processes in purchasing, clipping (by driver upon boarding), and recording paper tickets that are easily forgeable. No data analytics to efficiently schedule busses.

*Solution:* A feature-rich, yet worry-free Progressive Web App (PWA) allowing users to safely top up and redeem their account balance for shuttle trips. Admin and Driver dashboards with advanced capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To ensure you have the required dependencies installed, run:

npm install
```

Be sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the configuration outlined in `.env.example`, **NEVER** check the `.env` file into GitHub.

### Starting (running) the Application

To start (run) the application, run:

```javascript
npm start
```
When running, changes to the code will automatically render in the browser. You will also need to start the [API Server](https://github.com/aut-shuttle/api) to interact with the application's back-end.
